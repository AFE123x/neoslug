    <h1>TODO for the RU SLUG Website</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Move To A <tt>rutgers.edu</tt> Subdomain</h2>
    <p>As the
     <a href="https://cs.rutgers.edu">Department of Computer
     Science</a> recognizes us as a club, this will hopefully be
     granted sooner rather than later. </p>

    <h2>Create a Functional Set of Links</h2>
    <p>As of right now, the <a href="./links.html">links</a> page
      redirects to a 503 error. We anticipate that we can one day
      curate a list of recommended resources for Unix-like and free
      and open-source software enthusiasts.</p>

    <h2>Recreate the Banner</h2>
    <p>The original banner was created in 2001 with the original
    iteration of the website. Blessed with the charm of the World Wide
    Web in those days, its visual clarity has not stood the test of
    time nearly as well. Most of the work will be locating the three
      different fonts used for the original.</p>

    <p><em>This task has been completed!</em><p>

    <h2>Get a Dedicated Server</h2>
    <p>Currently, the webmaster is using his own desktop as a
    webserver. For the small amount of traffic this site gets relative
    to the computational power available for the server to use, it is
    fine, but may be a security risk. We hope this sever may also find
    use as a SSH machine for the club's members.</p>
