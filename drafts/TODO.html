    <h1>TODO for the RU SLUG Website</h1>

  <div>
    <h2>Move To A <tt>rutgers.edu</tt> Subdomain</h2>
    <p>As the
     <a href="https://cs.rutgers.edu">Department of Computer
     Science</a> recognizes us as a club, this will hopefully be
     granted sooner rather than later. A faculty member will be
     required for the approval process, so people in good standing
     with professors are urged to get in contact with them.</p>

    <h2>Create a Functional Set of Links</h2>
    <p>As of right now, the <a href="./links/">links</a> page is very
      minimal. We anticipate that we can one day curate a list of
      recommended resources for Unix-like and free and open-source
      software enthusiasts both on and off-campus.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Get a Dedicated Server</h2>
    <p>Currently, the webmaster is using his own desktop as a
    webserver. For the small amount of traffic this site gets relative
    to the computational power available for the server to use, it is
    fine, but may be a security risk. We hope this sever may also find
    use as a SSH machine for the club's members.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Create a Mailing List</h2>
    <p>We hope to centralize discussion of the club, in particular
    announcements and upcoming events, in a publically-viewable
    mailing list.</p>
