<div><h2>About SLUG</h2>
  
<div><h3>Why are we here?</h3>
<p>SLUG is the Linux user group of Rutgers University. It was created
because there are currently no active Linux user groups accessible to
Rutgers students without a car. Our goal is to fill that void by
getting together with others who are also interested in Linux.</p></div>

<div><h3>Who should join SLUG?</h3>
<p>SLUG is for everyone who is interested in Linux, Unix-like
operating systems, free and open source software, and computers in
general. Even if you are not familiar with Linux, you are welcome to
come to meetings. No level of experience is required, as we are all
here to teach each other. Newbies and experts alike are all
  welcome.</p></div>
