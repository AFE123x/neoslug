    <h1>Topics for Future Meetings</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>The topics that RU SLUG meetings are about should be simple
    enough to be adequately explained in under an hour to an audience
    that only has a general knowledge of its background unless a
    substantial amount of members show interest in it. Below is a list
    of suggestions for talks and workshops, but members and guests
    alike are allowed to propose presentations and workshops on
    different topics.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Beginner Topics</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Introduction to Package Management</h3>
      <p>At the heart of almost every Linux distribution is
      a <em>package manager</em>, a mean by which users can easily
      obtain software and data usually provided by the maintainers of
      the distribution. These centralized sources, in addition to the
      freedom to choose alterantives, are for some the largest draw to
      the Linux family of operating system.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Shell Scripting</h3>
      <p>Why do so many Linux tools seem so cryptic, and why do so
      many users insist upon using the command line above graphical
      tools? The belief is that by having less complex software, the
      system as a whole can be more robust by there being less space
      for bugs to weaken it and by tools not having to reimplement
      each other. Indeed, it made more sense to the creators of the
      Unix operating system, for which Linux can be considered an
      open-source heir to, to connect programs together to
      achieve a particular task. <em>Shell scripting</em> is the
      standard way to do this, and involves the sequential execution
      of programs and the passing of data between these programs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Version Control Systems</h3>
      <p>Almost every software project today is managed by
      a <em>version control system</em>, a piece of software that logs
      changes to a directory.
      Today, <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> is considered to be
      the most popular version control system,
      though <a href="https://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> is
      a popular alternative
      and <a href="https://cvs.nongnu.org">Concurrent Version
      System</a> is used for much legacy open-source software.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Desktop Customization</h3>
      <p>There is a dizzying number of different graphical user
	interfaces available on free operating systems. While all aim
	to be as user-friendly as possible, each individual project
	has a different to creating something that its users will
	prefer to use. User interfaces on Linux are on spectrum from
	the highly-integrated GNOME and KDE that will be approachable
	for users of any experience, to the specialized "minimalist"
	user interfaces for advanced users.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Typesetting tools</h3>
      <p>Outside of what-you-see-is-what-you-get word processing
	software lies a rich set of tools for producing documents
	using only plain text. In mathematics, computer science, and
	physics, <a href="https://tug.org">TeX</a> is the single most
	common tool used to typeset papers, while
	<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
	is quite common for personal use and for software
	documentation.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>IEEE Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)</h3>
      <p>In the 1980s, the US government set to create a standard that
      computure operating systems would have to follow to be eligible
      for its use. A committee at IEEE quickly standardized around the
      popular
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_V_Unix">
	  System V Unix</a> as a base for the specification. While
      POSIX was not particularly successful in its goals for
      government contracts, it found new life as a standard that all
      Unix-like operating systems could use for portability between
      them.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Rust for Linux</h3>
      <p>Rust is an increasingly-popular systems programming that
      emphasizes memory safety. In 2022, the Linux kernel began to
      allow developers to submit code in Rust.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The X Window System</h3>
      <p>The X Windowing System is the standard graphical user
      interface protocol for Unix-like systems. As a server, it has
      functionalities beyond serving a single user: it may forward the
      graphical output of a program over an internet, as was common in
      many organizations that could not afford dedicated workstations.
      It may also be used on operating systems that are not Unix-like
      at all, also being the standard graphical user interface
      protocol on OpenVMS.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Wayland Protocol</h3>
      <p>X11 developers at Freedesktop.org saw the standard protocol
      as having inherent security flaws, such as the ability for a
      program to know the state of all others in the same X
      environment. Furthermore, looking to modernize the way users
      interact with their environments, the new Wayland protocol was
      designed to take advantage of hardware graphics acceleration
      universally present on modern PCs, tablets, and
      smartphones.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Î¼CLinux</h3>
      <p>Maintained fork of the Linux kernel designed to run
      on microcontrollers without a memory-management unit.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>SELinux</h3>
      <p>Security-Enhanced Linux. It is the default kernel on the Red
      Hat family of distributions, which includes Fedora and CentOS
      Stream.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Monolithic Kernels versus Microkernels</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the single largest choice an operating system
      designer can make is that between a monolithic kernel, which
      holds most the core functionality of the operating system within
      the kernel, or as a microkernel, which is as small as possible
      and has external software in userspace perform most of the
      operating system's duties. In the first year of the Linux
      kernel's development, this was a point in controversy: Andrew
      Tanenbaum, the creator of Minix, thought the monolithic kernel
      design was outdated even in 1991, while Linus Torvalds held to
      his opinion that a monolithic kernel was more practical for
      production use.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>System Administration</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Package Management with Nix</h3>
      <p>Nix is a package manager that is configured by a
      functionalprogramming language also called Nix.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Virtual Machines</h3>
      <p>A virtual machine is a class of emulator that is expected to
      replicate all the functionalites and behavior of a physical
      machine in real time. They are particularly useful for testing
      and debugging system software and software that runs on an
      operating system not native to the host.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dockers</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Choosing a Shell</h3>
      <p>There are several different shells, with each operating
      system seeming to have a different default. On just about every
      system, there exists a limited POSIX-complient shell useful for
      basic tasks that require portability, but for interactive use,
      BASH, ZSH, and FISH are more common. Users of older systems may
      also be familiar with Korn shell.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Securing a Unix System</h3>
      <p>In production and at home, system administrators have become
      increasingly aware of the security threats that a system may
      face when exposed to people inside and outside the organization
      it belongs to. There is a list of standard techniques and
      preferred solutions to mitigate security risks.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>PGP Encryption</h3>
      <p>Pretty Good Protection is a common standard for encryption on
      machines running a Unix-like operating system. GNU Privacy Guard
      is one implementation of it. In particular, this workshop or
      presentation should focus upon encrypting e-mail with it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Networked File Systems</h3>
      <p>Users increasingly want to access their data remotely. From
      the 1980s, Sun Microsystems, a vendor of Unix workstations, had
      created the Network File System standard for multiple devices to
      access the same storage over a network. For Windows and OS/2
      users, Common Internet File System (CIFS), formely know as
      Server Message Block, is the standard protocol to access
      information over an internet. Both have been implemented as
      servers within the Linux kernel.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Compiling a Linux Kernel</h3>
      <p>For many users of Linux-based operating systems, recompiling
      one's own kernel is a rite of passage to becoming an advanced
      user. By understanding the features and options that the kernel
      has, users may enable functionality they need or disable
      functionality they do not need to save space and improve
      performance, especially during startup. On modern systems, the
      task of configuring and compiling a Linux kernel is not
      especially involved, but contains many options that may not seem
      especially clear even with the included documentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Writing Manual Pages</h3>
      <p>Documentation is often overlooked by developers, especially
      in fast-moving projects, but is the user's main way of
      understanding what a particular protocol or piece of software
      does. The on-line manual page format has been relatively
      standard and straightforward since its inception in the 1970s,
      and will be second nature to those familar with
      the <tt>troff</tt> typesetting utility.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Volume Managers</h3>
      <p>When computer systems grow large enough, they may include
      multiple hard drives. To increase performance, back up data, and
      create a seamless user experience, volume management software
      can make an operating system view multiple disks as a single
      large volume. On Linux-based
      systems, <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/lvm2/">Logical
      Volume Management</a> is common,
      while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> is
      common on Linux, BSD, and Solaris operating systems, especially
      in enterprise use or in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a>
      installations.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>SystemD</h3>
      <p>SystemD is the most controversal part of modern GNU/Linux
      systems. Seeking to do more than traditional init systems, it is
      seen as overly-complicated and difficult to maintain, and in
      general at odds with the principles that make the Unix-like
      family of operating systems attractive.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Non-Linux Operating Systems</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</h3>
      <p>In the 1980s, the University of California, Berkeley gained
      access to the Unix source. Associates of the university modified
      the sources and distributed them under a special license that
      allowed people to distribute the software nearly without
      restriction. These modified sources later became foundational to
      several commercial Unix variants. In the late 1980s, a company
      looking to commercialize the product called BSDi was founded.
      Although the vast majority of the operating system was free
      software derived from the BSD project, six files relating to the
      networking code that originated from AT&amp;T were still present
      within their operating system's source code. AT&amp;T promptly
      sued BSDi, but the court ruled in favor of the startup's favor.
      This operating system, known as 386BSD, became the base for the
      subsequent free BSD projects which are active thirty years
      later, most notably FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</h3>
      <p>As a replacement for the previous Windows NT "personality"
      that could run POSIX programs and Windows Services for Unix,
      Microsoft has bundled Linux compatibility into Windows starting
      with Windows 10. Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) uses a
      complete Linux kernel and has compatibility with graphical
      programs on the Windows API.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Plan 9 From Bell labs</h3>
      <p>Named for the cult classic Ed Wood film
	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/">Plan 9 From
	Outer Space</a>, this operating system was created by the
	original developers of Unix as a continuation of several
	enents of its design design philosophy -- simplicity,
	maintainability, and "everything is a file" -- while adding
	support for new features such as distributed computing and
	graphical user interfaces.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Unix Workstations</h3>
      <p>Before GNU/Linux became the most popular Unix-like operating
      system for software development, servers, and scientific
      computing, and before the Personal Computer platform was seen as
      capable enough for these applications, vendors of specialized
      high-end personal computers each offered their own variant of
      Unix, usually based on Version 7 Unix, System V Unix, or BSD.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Social Issues in Computing</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Free Software Licenses</h3>
      <p>In the past decade, releasing one's own software as
       open-source has become the standard practice. Most people who
       release open-source software prefer to give a higher degree of
       freedom to the software's users: they may choose a free
       software license that enables this. Choosing between the myriad
       ready-to-use licenses or writing a new license is a point of
       concern for many developers who may not understand the rights
       they are or are not granting their software's users.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Intel Management Engine and Free BIOSes</h3>
      <p>The BIOS (basic input/output system) is the last piece of
      common computer software that does not have a standard free
      implementation. The Intel Management engine is a small CPU core
      present on the motherboard's chipset that currently has an
      unknown purpose, but runs a fully-featured multitasking
      operating system and has complete access to the computer's
      hardware, including the memory, disks, and network interfaces. A
      common goal of free BIOS projects is to disable this device.</p>
