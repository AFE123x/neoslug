    <h1>RUSLUG Constitution</h1>
<h2><a href="./resources/RUSLUG_Constitution.pdf">Read as a
PDF</a><h2></div>
  
<div><p><strong>ARTICLE I</strong> The name of this Organization shall be
  "RUSLUG," short for Rutgers Student Linux User’s Group.</p></div>

<div><p><strong>ARTICLE II</strong> We hope to expand the exposure of
free software on campus and provide a space for enthusiasts to gather
and discuss Linux and other related projects. Rutgers currently lacks
a "for fun" Computer Science/IT organization. RUSLUG will provide
enthusiasts a space to discuss their passion for free software
technology and provides an avenue for newcomers to approach a
typically intimidating community. We value inclusivity, accessibility,
and passion for free software advocacy and providing a place for
enthusiasts to gather. We hope for greater adoption of user respecting
software and hardware and believe in the user's rights as outlined by
the Free Software Foundation. We support any initiatives to increase
free software adoption, learning about new technology from our peers,
and having fun with technology. RUSLUG is a completely independent
    organization.</p></div>
<div>
  <div><p>Our core values include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility and collaboration:</strong> A central aspect
of Open Source Philosophy.
<li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> We welcome members regardless of background and
proficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Technologies:</strong> We promote open-source
technologies granting user rights, freedom, and willingness to
experiment.</li>
<ul>
  </div>
  
<div><p>RUSLUG will host:</p>
  <ul>
<li><strong>Installfests</strong> and <strong>key sharing</strong>
events every month to help new users and to help members get to know
each other.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly</strong> discussions and <strong>howtos</strong>
  for members to show what they’re working on and others to learn from
  their peers.</li>
<li><strong>Guest Speakers</strong> to connect with Alumni and members
  of the free software community outside of Rutgers.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy Campaigns</strong> to help spread awareness about
user respecting technologies.</li></ul></div></div>

<div><p><strong>ARTICLE III</strong> Membership shall be open to all

origin, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and

on the executive board at a time.</li>

<li><strong>Section III</strong> If no valid candidates are elected

harms the organization and/or any of its members. Such claims must be

charges. The executive board shall inform the officer of any such
charges immediately or as soon as possible of any such claims. The
